	<p>This is a new product that I have been working on. I developed this product for my own beard to keep it soft and shiny and to condition the skin under my beard&mdash;there is nothing worse than an itchy beard&hellip;right?. The product is hand made and mixed, all oils and essential oils are 100% organic (no synthetics) and safe for use every day. The product leaves no oily residue and is better for your skin than anything I've tried.</p>
	<p>The product comes in 3 fragrances: Forest, Zen and Naked.</p>
	<p><img src="images/manescape.jpg" alt="picture of manescape bottle of beard oil"></p>
	<p>All Manescape&trade; Beard Oils are a mixture of Jojoba, Sweet almond &amp; Argon oil. Then essential oils complete the scent and the experience leaving you with a soft, shiny and wonderfully scented beard. Unless of course you prefer the naked truth unscented</p>
	<p>Which ever oil you choose, your skin and beard will thank you.</p>
