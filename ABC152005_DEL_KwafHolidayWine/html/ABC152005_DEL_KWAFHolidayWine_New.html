	    <h1>THREE (3) SPECIAL HOLIDAY WINE OFFERS</h1>
	    <p>American Express<sup><font size="1">&reg;</font></sup> Cardmembers are invited to take advantage of special prerelease wine offers* from kw&auml;f.ca, Two Sisters Vineyards, Stratus Vineyards, and Tawse Winery. Just in time for holiday gifting, Cardmembers have presale access to purchase three (3) superb red wines: the Two Sisters Vineyards 2012 Eleventh Post, the Stratus Vineyards 2012 Petit Verdot, and the Tawse 2012 Cherry Avenue Pinot Noir before they're released to the general public in February 2015.</p>

		<p>All three wines hail from the formidable 2012 vintage, which according to Ontario's Vintners Quality Alliance, saw a long, warm growing season that nurtured incredible ripeness and depth in the grapes. The result? Magnificent, age-worthy wines fit for the most serious of wine cellars.</p>

			<h2>STRATUS VINEYARDS 2012 PETIT VERDOT<sup>1</sup></h2>
			<p class="copyleft">A favourite of American Express Cardholders, <b>Stratus Winery</b> is a pioneer in ultra-premium Bordeaux-style wines. This year, it marks its 10th anniversary with such highlights as being the first winery in the world to be accredited with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification as well as seeing its flagship Stratus Red served to President Barack Obama at a lunch hosted in Ottawa. Stratus Winemaker J&#8209;L Groux, a native of France's Loire Valley, has been named Ontario Winemaker of the Year and his <b>Stratus 2012 Petit Verdot</b> is a remarkable wine. Rarely bottled on its own, the kw&auml;f Taste Buds<sup>2</sup> rated this Petit Verdot 90+ points, with sommelier Zoltan Szabo declaring: &quot;This is a delicious red, with complex aromatics of black raspberry, black currant jam, roasted plums, bittersweet chocolate, lavender, and nutmeg. Full bodied, bold&hellip; plenty of succulent fruit here, gentle, well-integrated tannins, and a great length.&quot;</p>

			<p class="copyleft">Last but not least, the <b>Tawse 2012 Cherry Avenue Pinot Noir</b> is practically tailor-made for a holiday roast turkey. Winner of the Canadian Wine Awards' &quot;Winery of the Year&quot; for three years running (2010 to 2012), Tawse is building an international reputation for its biodynamic, hand-crafted wines, garnering praise in the U.K.'s Decanter magazine this past spring. Tawse is well known for its expertise in Pinot Noir. Rating the wine&nbsp;91 points, kw&auml;f's Lindsay Groves said: &quot;As elegant and intricate as a snowflake, this is a lean and polished Pinot that will give you plenty to contemplate (while you're toasty beside the fire on a chilly winter night).&quot;</p>
